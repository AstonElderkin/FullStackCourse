2 reasons/ways to use italics:
1 - To make a point/verbal emphasise. 'Favourite'. <em>
2 - To make it stand out. Generic. Visual only italics. <i>
<p>My <em>favourite</em> character from <i>Sesame Street</i> is Grover.</p>

2 reasons/ways to use bold:
1 - Importance, seriousness, urgency. <strong>
2 - Generic. Visual only Bold. No meaning. <b>
<h1><strong>Warning!</strong> Do not be late.</h1>
<h2><strong>Chocolate and coffee</strong> and other things I crave</h2>

<p>This is a paragraph of text. Let's pretend it's part of a long article, where we expect many people to quickly scan through it, and 
<b>we want to mark certain phrases with some boldness</b>, some visual attention, so that those sentences jump out and people don't miss them. 
Almost like having a pull-quote.</p>
